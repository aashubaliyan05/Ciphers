# Ciphers
Here are the Encyption and Decryption programs to various types of ciphers in C++.

Cipher
A cipher is an algorithm for performing encryption or decryptionâ€”a series of well-defined steps that can be followed as a procedure.
An alternative, less common term is encipherment.

Encryption
A message is plaintext (sometimes called cleartext). The process of disguising a message in such away as to hide its substance is encryption.

Decryption
An encrypted message is ciphertext. The process ofturning ciphertext back into plaintext is decryption.
